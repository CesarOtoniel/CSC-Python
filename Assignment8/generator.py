Modify the sentence-generator program of Case Study 5-1 (in the file 
generator.py) so that it inputs its vocabulary from a set of text files 
at startup. The filenames are nouns.txt, verbs.txt, articles.txt, and 
prepositions.txt. (Hint: Define a single new function, getWords . 
This function should expect a filename as an argument. The function 
should open an input file with this name, define a temporary list, read 
words from the file, and add them to the list. The function should then 
convert the list to a tuple and return this tuple. Call the function with 
an actual filename to initialize each of the four variables for the 
vocabulary.)
