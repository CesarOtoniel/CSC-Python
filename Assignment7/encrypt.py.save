Problem:Write a script that inputs a line of plaintext 
and a distance value and outputs an encrypted text using 
a Caesar cipher. The script should work for any printable
characters.

1. Significant contants:

	none

2. The inputs are:

	plainText #Text to be encoded 
	
	distance  #distance beetween the value of 
		  #ord() of the encrypted and 
		  #unencrypted letter 

3. Computations:

	cipherValue #new ord() value in ciphered character

4. The outputs are:
	code        #string with all the ciphered values
"""

# Initialize the constants

# Request inputs
file_name = input("Enter the file name: ")
code = ""
# Computations
with open(file_name, 'r') as file:
    plainText = file.read()
    for ch in plainText:
        shiftedValue = ord(ch) << 1
        bitString = bin(shiftedValue)[2:]
        bitString = bitString.zfill(8)
        code += bitString + ' '

code = code.rstrip()

with open("Encrypted.txt", 'w') as outputFile:
    outputFile.write(code)
